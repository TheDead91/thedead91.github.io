# Conclusions
First…oh my god! 6 years in a row I’m sending this report. Must have bored you by now 😁
I loved this new format of releasing the challenges in multiple tranches and allowing more time overall - I still ended up with having a working LFI for the Decrypt challenge only on Jan 1st 😁

## The Amazon Gift Card 🎁
I also loved the sharing moment, not just because I won an Amazon Gift card, but because I loved to see people sharing their achievements!
But still… I also happen to have been picked by Jared’s favorite LLM!

## FOR SWAG AND FOR GLORY! 🔥
Since 2021, I have this thing of telling you to drop an email for something, and you actually do that, which is crazy, I love it, and I don’t see any good reason to stop now!

So, this year I have other final images for you, Carmageddon was one of my childhood glories and I loved having it as a theme:

So…let me know if you liked it and if you have any suggestion on how to spend a 25$ US gift card while based in Italy (e.g., digital books) or with a very limited time window in the US 😁

🤞 Fingers crossed that by when you reply I’ll be able to hit you back with a website to rate my reports’ images and memes through the year - I’d be very curious to know which ones you liked the most!

## ‘Till next year
