Help Angel Candysalt connect the dots in a game of connections.

## Hints
### Elf Connect Easy
*From: Angel Candysalt*  
I love brain games! This one is like the New York Times Connections game. Your goal here is to find groups of items that share something in common. Think of each group as having a hidden connection or theme-four items belong together, and there are multiple groups to find! See if you can spot patterns or common threads to make connections. Group all the items correctly to win!
### Elf Connect Hard
*From: Angel Candysalt*  
WOW! A high score of 50,000 points! That's way beyond the limit! With only four rounds and a max of 400 points per round, the top possible score should be 1,600 points. So, how did someone get to 50,000? Something unusual must be happening!

If you're curious, you might want to check under the hood. Try opening the browser's developer tools console and looking around-there might even be a variable named 'score' that could give you some insights. Sometimes, games hold secrets for those who dig a little deeper. Give it a shot and see what you can discover!

## Silver trophy
The JS of the page itself reveals the solutions, so I wrote a quick `nodejs` script to print them out and easily obtain `silver`:
```js
const wordSets = {
    1: ["Tinsel", "Sleigh", "Belafonte", "Bag", "Comet", "Garland", "Jingle Bells", "Mittens", "Vixen", "Gifts", "Star", "Crosby", "White Christmas", "Prancer", "Lights", "Blitzen"],
    2: ["Nmap", "burp", "Frida", "OWASP Zap", "Metasploit", "netcat", "Cycript", "Nikto", "Cobalt Strike", "wfuzz", "Wireshark", "AppMon", "apktool", "HAVOC", "Nessus", "Empire"],
    3: ["AES", "WEP", "Symmetric", "WPA2", "Caesar", "RSA", "Asymmetric", "TKIP", "One-time Pad", "LEAP", "Blowfish", "hash", "hybrid", "Ottendorf", "3DES", "Scytale"],
    4: ["IGMP", "TLS", "Ethernet", "SSL", "HTTP", "IPX", "PPP", "IPSec", "FTP", "SSH", "IP", "IEEE 802.11", "ARP", "SMTP", "ICMP", "DNS"]
};

let correctSets = [[0, 5, 10, 14], [1, 3, 7, 9], [2, 6, 11, 12], [4, 8, 13, 15]];

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(wordSets)) {
    console.log (`####################`)
    console.log (`wordSet       --> ${value}`)
    for (var i = 0; i < correctSets.length; i ++) {
        correctSet = correctSets[i]
        let answer = []
        for (var j = 0; j < correctSet.length; j ++) {
            answer.push(value[correctSet[j]])
        }
        console.log (`correctSet #${i} --> ${answer}`)   
    }
    console.log (`####################`)
}
```
```js

## Gold trophy
Analyzing the JS for `score` it's possible to notice it gets incremented by `100` on correct answers:
```js
// Update score by 100 points
score += 100;
```
By modifying the `score` from DevTools and triggering a correct answer, I achieved the gold trophy:
