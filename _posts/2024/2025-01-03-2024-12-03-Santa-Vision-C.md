Using the information available to you in the SantaVision platform, subscribe to the frostbitfeed MQTT topic. Are there any other feeds available? What is the code name for the elves' secret operation?

## Hints
*From: Ribb Bonbowford*
(Gold hint) Sometimes the answers are in the quiet moments. Pay attention to every feed and signal—you may find what you're looking for hidden deep in the streams.

## Silver
Listening on the `santafeed` feed one message caught my attention:
```bash
(act3-SantaVision) thedead@maccos act3-SantaVision % mosquitto_sub -v -h 34.44.88.211 -p 1883 -u SantaBrokerAdmin -P 8r0k3R4d1mp455wD -t 'santafeed'
santafeed Sixteen elves launched operation: Idemcerybu
```
The answer to the silver trophy is name of the operation: `Idemcerybu`
## Gold
By following the hint of being 16 elves launching the operation and therefore applying ROT16 to `Idemcerybu`, we can observe it becomes `Snowmobile`. Turns out `snowmobile` is the answer to the gold trophy.
## Thanks to @Shuckle Lord Mixone
Because...my mind was so not connecting the dots :)
